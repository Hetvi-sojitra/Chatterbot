# Chatterbot
"A chatbot, also known as a chatterbot or AI assistant, is a software application used for online chat conversations via text. We implemented a menu/button-based chatbot in Java, with predefined functions generating appropriate responses based on user input."


The implemented functionalities of this software application showcase a diverse range of features that enable interactive and dynamic user experiences. The application centers around a chatbot, proficiently executing tasks based on user input through a menu-based interface. It demonstrates versatility and practicality by incorporating various functionalities, each designed to cater to specific user needs.

The ability to send live images between devices distinguishes the chatbot, effectively making use of Java's "Byteoutputstream" in the "java.io" package for seamless image transmission. Furthermore, inter-device communication is seamlessly facilitated through socket programming, enabling a smooth exchange of messages between the server and client.

The application also allows users to open URLs of popular websites, such as Google, Gmail, and Netflix, leveraging the power of "desk.browser." Users can conveniently play locally stored music using the "AudioPlayer.player.start" functionality, an import from "sun.audio."

A remarkable addition is the interactive tic-tac-toe game, skillfully integrated into the console for enjoyable entertainment. For those seeking intriguing knowledge, the chatbot offers the pleasure of learning random facts, further enhancing the user experience.

Users can set customized timers, an indispensable utility for managing time-sensitive tasks. When the timer expires, the chatbot triggers an audio alert, utilizing "AudioPlayer.player.start" from "sun.audio" for a pleasant user experience.

The inclusion of a calendar display, employing "java.util.Locale," offers convenient access to date and time information within the console. An impressive feature is the chatbot's text-to-speech capability, realized through "javax.speech.Central" and "javax.speech.synthesis.Synthesizer," enabling the bot to articulate user-entered text.

Throughout the implementation, essential programming concepts are employed, exemplifying the software's robust design. String functions and string buffers ensure efficient handling of text data, while methods, classes, objects, and constructors facilitate modular and structured programming.

The software aptly incorporates parameterized methods and constructors, enhancing code reusability and adaptability. Moreover, meticulous exception handling ensures smooth execution, mitigating potential runtime errors. Inheritance fosters code reusability, promoting a maintainable and extensible architecture.

This software effectively utilizes various pre-defined classes and packages, such as "java.util.Locale," "java.time," "java.awt.Desktop," "java.net," and "javax.speech.Central." Such adept use of pre-existing resources underscores the developer's proficiency in leveraging Java's rich ecosystem of libraries.


CONCEPTS USED The concepts that we have implemented in the code are:

1.String functions

2.String buffer

3.Methods/ classes/ objects/ constructors

4.Parameterized methods and constructors

5.Exception handling

6.Inheritance

7.Using pre defined classes like java.util.Locale, java.time (for calendar and time) java.awt.Desktop (for accessing files on desktop) java.net (for URL access) javax.speech.Central (for text to speech)

In summary, the software exemplifies a sophisticated chatbot application featuring an array of practical functionalities, adeptly implemented using core Java concepts and pre-defined classes. Its seamless interactivity and engaging user experience make it a valuable asset for diverse contexts, from utility-driven tasks to entertainment and information dissemination.
